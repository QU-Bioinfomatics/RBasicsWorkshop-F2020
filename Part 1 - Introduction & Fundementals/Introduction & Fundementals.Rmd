This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

math operations

no modulus operation
all numbers treated as numbers instead of num and float like in python
log is assumed to be natural log
trig functions are in radians
```{r}
1+1
1+1.1
20-5
3*5
15/5

sqrt(9)
log(100)
log10(100)

sin(pi)
```
rounding decimal places and significant figures
floor and ceiling round to nearest whole numbers, floor rounds down and ceiling rounds up
```{r}
round(123.245, digits = 2)
signif(123.245, digits = 2)

floor(123.245)
ceiling(123.245)
```

logic operators return boolean values (true or false)
for the logic operator and to be true, both statements must be true
for the logic operator or to be true, either statement must be true 
```{r}
1 < 2
2 <= 2
3+3 == 6
3+3 != 3*3

1 < 2 & 1 > 3
1 < 2 | 1 > 3
```

generating random numbers from normal/uniform distribution
```{r}
runif(5, min = 0, max = 10)
rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```
declaring a variable
print function simply prints its argument as it is, paste function
converts the arguments data type to a string and then prints it
```{r}
a <- 8177919
print(a)
paste(a)
```
declaring vector (notice how index starts from 1 instead of 0)
square brackets subsets a vector
```{r}
b <- c(1:5, "R basic")
b
b[1]
```
list stuff - each element in a list has a name (height, name)
The first element height is a uniform distribution with random numbers
The second element name is a list within a list, it contains strings
Can subset a list by name by using $
```{r}
c <- list(height=runif(5, min = 160, max = 180), name=c("bob", "lauren", "john", "ashley", "taylor"))
c
c$height
c$name
```
conditional
if statement: if operator condition is true, then print string
if false, print a different string
for loop loops through numbers from 1 to the length of vector b and prints each element in b 
```{r}
if (2 > 1){
  print("2 is larger than 1")
} else {
  print("1 is larger than 2")
}

for (i in 1:length(b)){
  print(b[i])
}
```


import data for second part, check section 4 on Colautti's page for more
```{r}
getwd()
#setwd()
#dat <- read.csv("generic.csv", header = TRUE)
#names(dat)
#head(dat)
```
